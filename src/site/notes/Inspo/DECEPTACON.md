The character and monster design as well as usage of color in this one really gets me. 
"Rotwolf" design elements: the combination of prey and predator create this this odd in-between of boar and dog that feels unnatural and sickly. The bulging heads and horizontal eyes add to the feeling of 'incorrect anatomy'
The way Winnipeg the main character moves almost feels like a hummingbird or a jumping spider
Also impeccable direction, again, the story told is so concise and beautifully done
