# [TWRP - Starlight Brigade (feat. Dan Avidan)]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9Q3i5w6-Ug]())

Seen for the first time when I was thirteen or twelve, genuinely changed my brain chemistry, flipped a little switch for me. I've cried countless times to this, I'm not saying this video is the sole reason I chose to pursue animation, however .... its close.
Another beautiful and complete story told with no dialogue and only ~4 minutes of runtime
