Worthikids one of my favorites of all time, easy to get the gist of all his shit through 'Wire', although 'Bigtop Burger' belongs on this list. Insane immediate worldbuilding. Guerilla clowns using the vampire hostage to get a portal straight to the monster castle where the baby clown is being held separately hostage. Final clown v monster showdown...
AND Ian Worthington makes his OWN MUSIC!!!! and its CATCHY???
