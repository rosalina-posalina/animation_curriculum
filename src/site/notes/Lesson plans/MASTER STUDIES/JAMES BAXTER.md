James Baxter is a legendary figure in classic and modern animation, he has titles under his name such as "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" "Beauty and the Beast" and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" specifically notorious for hand illustrating some of their most intense 2d animated scenes. He frequently uploads his "pencil tests" (paper illustrations, on PAPER) to both his Tumblr and Youtube channel.
Although his posts are fewer and further between, via his tumblr its clear that he's still working to directly interact with his audience through workshops.


One such particularly notable scene is Quasimodo scaling Notre Dame, in which Baxter manages to perfectly and smoothly capture the perspective of a rotating building by hand. Released in 1996,

Another moment highlighting his sheer range is a scene towards the finale of the Cartoon Network show "Steven Universe" in which the main character Steven embraces a separated version of himself, while the character White Diamond observes them. Steven then proceeds to twirl himself around as the entire stage rotates, for the longest time I thought this was animated with CGI. (2019)

Additional notes on Baxter's animation:
- His usage of arcs is so frequent its impossible to note them all, try to point some out to yourself! How does he use them to convey emotion through movement?
