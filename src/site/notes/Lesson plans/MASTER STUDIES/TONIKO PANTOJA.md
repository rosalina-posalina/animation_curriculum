An independent and industry animator who's worked at studios such as Cartoon Network, Netflix, Dreamworks, Warner Bros. He's won over half a dozen awards for his short films. As well as two of my favorite pieces of animated media Kipo and Puss in Boots 2. He not only shares his work process but uploads advice videos, tutorials, and being extremely open with his process and art journey.
