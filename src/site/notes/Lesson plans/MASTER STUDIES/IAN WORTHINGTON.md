Ian Worthington is my hero. Once again, I wont say that any one person caused me to pursue animation as my degree, but I would be lying if I didn't say Worthikids (his screen name) was a large influence in my journey.

His animations feel original and his style is something I havent seen before in an era of samey-industry animation, Worthikids truly feels like a breath of fresh air. He uses a free software that's accessible to anyone and posts tutorials for the general public as well as videos of his full process for paying members.

He has an online series animated solely by himself but featuring amazing voice talents
