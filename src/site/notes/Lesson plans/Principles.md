With each gif, I aim to explain one of the twelve principles of animation, how they're used in context, and why they're important.

### Squash and stretch

Squash and stretch gives an object volume, it can make something appear soft, bouncy or rigid. When the volume of the object stays consistent when using squash and stretch it gives the appearance or realism in animation, however, this can be exaggerated for more impact within the action. 
Example: A ball drops from a high place, as it falls it stretches out slightly and when it lands it compresses before bouncing back up into its original shape.

### Staging
Staging directs the viewers eye to the specific location the artist wants.

### Solid drawing
Solid drawing places the object into a three dimensional plane. Otherwise it creates

### Appeal
Appeal is the art of character design, it allows the audience to connect with the character, whether that's creating villains that are hate-able, or protagonists that are cute and empathetic.
Shown below is the cube from before, but it's given a personality through its movements, jumping and twirling excitedly.
