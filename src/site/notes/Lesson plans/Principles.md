## 12 Principles of Animation
A study of the 12 principles of animation

With each gif, I aim to explain one of the twelve principles of animation, how they're used in context, and why they're important.
(Warning! Gifs likely to display static images when viewing on computers and phones, the dev is currently working to resolve this issue)

### Squash and Stretch
Squash and stretch gives an object volume, it can make something appear soft, bouncy or rigid. When the volume of the object stays consistent when using squash and stretch it gives the appearance or realism in animation, however, this can be exaggerated for more impact within the action. 
Example: A ball drops from a high place, as it falls it stretches out slightly and when it lands it compresses before bouncing back up into its original shape.

### Anticipation
Subtle movement to show a pre-action quite literally building up a miniscule bit of "anticipation" for the action that is going to come. Like pushing down on a spring before releasing, winding up before a punch, or crouching before leaping into the air. This is easily paired wish squash and stretch,

### Staging
Staging directs the viewers eye to the specific location the artist wants. This can be used alongside composition and background design to create scenes that are pleasing for the viewers and tell stories that are clear and easy to follow.

### Straight ahead action and pose to pose
One of the most difficult to explain principles of animation, it's less about the final product, and more about the process itself. 
Pose to pose involves drawing the key poses first, then drawing the "inbetween" frames.
Straight ahead involves drawing the illustrations in the sequence they occur.

### Follow through and overlapping action
The secondary parts of the object and or action, that continue moving after the initial action. This particularly is apparent when depicting physical properties like drag in animation. Or, how when an object makes a sudden stop, things like hair, clothing, or accessories may continue moving slightly before coming to a stop as well.

### Slow in and slow out
Also known as "easing, the gradual acceleration and deceleration of movement. Such as starting an action quickly and ending slowly, starting slowly and ending quickly, or a combination of some sort. It causes motion to look far more natural and organic, by using more frames at the beginning of an action, and less towards the middle.

### Arc
Arcs give movement fluidity, rather than things moving in straight or diagonal lines animators choose to move in rounded arcs. This can make organic things feel more lifelike, or, when intentionally removed can make movement feel static and stilted.

### Secondary action
Secondary action refers to objects moving **with** the main action. Such as a limb swinging as a character walks across the screen, or smoke billowing off a campfire, hair moving as a character stands up.

### Timing
Timing can create the illusion of realism by showing objects obeying the laws of physics. Timing refers to how long an action takes from beginning to end, as well as the velocity, speed, and distribution of frames. A slow flying blimp will have more frames than a fast moving jet.

### Exaggeration
Exaggeration pushes animation from static to more fluid. It provides more vivid motion which is more appealing to the eye. It can make actions or expressions appear larger, and more important by extending movement. It also can make things more cartoony or realistic.

### Solid drawing
Solid drawing places the object into a three dimensional plane. It creates convincing and believable animation. 
The example below shows a cube transferring from a 2d to a 3d plane, 8 white directional lines are displayed

### Appeal
Appeal is the art of character design, it allows the audience to connect with the character, whether that's creating villains that are hate-able, or protagonists that are cute and empathetic.
Shown below is the cube from before, but it's given a personality through its movements, jumping and twirling excitedly.
