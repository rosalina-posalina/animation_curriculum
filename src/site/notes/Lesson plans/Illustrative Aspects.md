I'd like to go more in depths beyond explanations but this is what I have for now!

### Characters and character design
https://graphicmama.com/blog/character-design-process/
	Just like how you can understand aspects of a person just by looking at them, this is doubly important in animation and visual storytelling. Physical attributes, shape language, color pallettes, and even costuming can change how the audience views a character. (Show, don't tell.)

### Backgrounds

	Backgrounds establish the setting visually, a good background can tell the viewer everything they need to know about the location the story takes place in. They can create certain emotions, and further the narrative. Without backgrounds characters are literally just floating in blank space. Changes in background can also show how the story is changing.

### Prop design

	 Prop design can make characters feel multidimensional, define characters and visually communicate details about them. They can also help establish the setting.
	 You can tell things about the setting if the characters use corded phones connected to the wall, or if they have flipphones, or if they have holographic microchip thinggies.
	You can immediately tell things from a character if they chose to buy a pink and purple phone case covered with stickers and charms, or if they go for a thick protective case with grips, or a sleek black phone case with a metalic finish. Each of these can immedately conjure and image in your brain of what that person may be like.

### Composition

	Good composition arranges the visuals in a way that is pleasing to the eye, can tell a story by being able to 'read' the scene. It can create a mood (cramped, spooky, detached, airy, happy). 
	Can prevent compositions from looking awkward and amateurish

### Effects

	Effects can function as visual cues, make action sequences more engaging and far more interesting to the audience. They (once again) build the environment, such as weather, and ambience and organic occurrences such as fire or smoke.
	
### Compositing(?)

	Combination of separate visual elements and layers to create a final cohesive image and scene. Background, midground, foreground, characters, effects, filters? Making animations look more professional
