## [[Lesson plans/Illustrative Aspects\|Illustrative Aspects]]
Illustrative aspects is the most thoroughly filled out segment of lessons so far. Each segment contains a link to an article, and I will be directly studying, notetaking, and producing my own work from it.

## [[Lesson plans/Principles\|Principles]]
Principles has gifs for daily workshops I'd like to work on focusing on the 12 principles of animation

## [[Lesson plans/Studying the masters\|Studying the masters]]
Annotations directly on top of live animation (via videos) as well as notes, history and commentary on who I consider to be my personal animation heroes.
