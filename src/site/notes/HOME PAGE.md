Idea Generation
(Links within text lead to other pages on this ((my)) website, its all interconnected

1. **Begin by determining your topic and providing a brief summary**
Animation! To put it simply it's moving pictures on a screen, to put it silly it's literally magic because we're as humans have the ability to create whole moving complex worlds from nothing, and to put it in the best way possible it's the illusion movement through puppets or illustration to convey a message.
I particularly like animation in regards to storytelling and film, however it can be used in advertising, graphic design, app design and more.


2. **Why is your topic important and relevant in 2025?**
The animation industry is in a really bizarre place right now, thousands are becoming disillusioned with the monopolies of the animation world (Disney... Disney.) And are turning to [indie animation](obsidian://open?vault=Animation%20Curriculum&file=Inspo%2FFavorites%20of%20all%20time), particularly on youtube and other social media sites. This excites me greatly, as I've always wanted to launch my own pet projects to an audience without having to go through the art-student -> animation industry pipeline.

Additionally, generative [[Essay/AI\|AI]] is a massive disruptor and one of the most controversial art debates of all time. In my personal belief, it's a monster that we as humans may have let grow too large to control. Ai is everywhere, and trying to be more everywhere. Art is a form of human expression, I truly believe ai images are not, and will never be art, no matter how much they attempt to replace us. No matter how much the industry gets bogged down by soulles ai attempts at creativity.
This brings up many interesting debates to be explored!


3. What do you hope to learn from your curriculum?
I want to learn how to (at the end of this, if i had infinite time) make my own short!
